## Overview
The **Super License Tracker** is a web application designed to track the points required for a driver to obtain an FIA Super License. It provides an API to store and retrieve data on points earned by drivers in various racing categories, as well as a frontend interface to visualize this data.

## Features
- **API with Express & TypeScript**: A backend built using Express.js and TypeScript.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Database storage and schema modeling.
- **Redis Integration**: Caching for improved performance.
- **React Frontend**: A web interface to display driver rankings and points.
- **Deployment Ready**: Designed for production use with Atlas for database hosting.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Redis
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker, Vercel/Render (for frontend), Railway/Fly.io (for backend)
